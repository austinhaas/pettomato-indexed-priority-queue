  "Return a new empty queue.

compare-fn is a function that takes two arguments and returns a true
value iff the first argument should be prioritized higher in the
queue. If the two items have equal priority, then compare-fn should
return nil.

set-index-fn and get-index-fn are a pair. Some queue operations (e.g.,
queue-delete) require that the index for an item can be
retrieved. These functions allow the user to control how that mapping
is maintained.

set-index-fn is a function that takes two arguments: the first is an
item in the queue and the second is the current index position of that
item in the heap. This function should do something to record the
association between the item and the index. Each item's index may
change many times while it is stored in the queue; this function will
be called each time.

get-index-fn is a function that takes an item and returns the heap
index that was associated with it via set-index-fn. get-index-fn must
return -1 if the item is not in the queue. The priority queue will
call set-index-fn with -1 when an item is being removed from the
queue, but that obviously only works for items it has seen before. If
there is a chance client code will try to call one of the operations
that relies on get-index-fn with items that have never been in the
queue, you must make sure that get-index-fn returns -1. See example
below.

A trivial way to implement set-index-fn / get-index-fn would be like
this:

 (let* ((hash (make-hash-table))
        (set-index-fn (lambda (item index))
                         (setf (gethash item hash) index))
        (get-index-fn (lamda (item)
                         (gethash item hash -1))))
   (make-empty-queue #'< set-index-fn get-index-fn))

Notice that get-index-fn returns -1 for items that aren't in the
hash. It might also be a good idea to change set-index-fn to something
like this:

 (lambda (item index)
    (if (= index -1)
        (remhash item hash)
        (setf (gethash item hash) index)))

Of course, this code all depends on each item being distinguishable
via 'eql, since that is the default test for a hash-table.

The motivation for handling the index maintenance this way is that it
is straightforward and flexible. Any item can be stored in the queue
and the user has control over how they are identified and where this
storage takes place. In many cases, it may make sense to store the
index directly as a property of the item being stored. In other cases,
we may want a looser mapping that only uses some attributes of the
item being stored, so that we can lookup similar items (e.g., if we
were using the priority queue in a search algorithm we could check to
see if the queue already contains a node with the same state as a
newly discovered node).
