** supply initial values
   - later we might want to allow adding several items at once; it
     might be more efficient to merge two heaps than insert each item
     one at a time.
     - one use case for this is merging back in the bucket of scores
       we left unsorted.
** add more profile tests
   - run tests with different sized heaps
   - compare against other implementations
     - pileup
     - cl-heap
   - simulate pathfinding
     - pop best off and add 5 more with a score slightly higher
     - this one should terminate after a set number of pops, since
       search stops when it finds the goal
   - simulate DES
     - pop best off and add 0-2 more events sometime in the future
** optimization: bucket for bad scores
   - after the array reaches a certain size (say 1000 items), chop off
     the last 500 items (the first will still be a heap) and store
     them in a separate array. Keep track of the best score in the
     bucket and decide if new items go into the bucket or the heap.
